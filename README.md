# Statistical-Data-Vizz-using-Plotly
Statistical Data Visualization using Plotly


In this project we will explore plotly express to visually statistical plots such as box plots, histograms, heat maps, density maps, contour plots and violent plots.

Some important background about plotly package.

- The plotly Python package empowers anyone to create, manipulate and render graphical figures.
- The figures are represented by data structures referred to as figures. 
- The rendering process uses the Plotly.js JavaScript library under the hood but you never need to use Java directly. 
- Figures can be represented in Python either as dictionaries or as instances of the plotly.graph_objects

__Note:__ 
1. Plotly Express is the recommended entry-point into the plotly package 
2. PLotly Express is the high-level plotly.express module that consists of Python functions which return fully-populated plotly.graph_objects.Figure objects. 
3. plotly.express module contains functions that can create interactive figures using a very few lines of code
4. Plotly Express is refered to as px. 
5. Plotly Express is a built-in part of the plotly library 
6. Plotly Express function uses graph objects internally and returns a plotly.graph_objects.Figure instance.

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1. Leverage the power of Plotly to generate interactive plots
2. Understand python programming fundamentals for interactive data visualization
3. Understand how to plot interactive statistical plots such as box plots, histograms, density map, scatter matrix, violin plot, and contour plot using Plotly Express
